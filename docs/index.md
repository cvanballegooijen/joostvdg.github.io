# Flusso CI/CD Knowledge Docs!
**CI/CD** stands for ***Continuous Integration*** & ***Continuous Delivery***.

This is a collection of docs for sharing Knowledge on CI/CD topics. We try to start things from customers' perspective in order to re-use all topics for multiple customers of Flusso. The main customer regarding CI/CD is ABN-ARMO bank. This acts as a starting point for this knowledge base. In the (near) future we might replace the contents of the wiki pages at Flusso with these way of documenting/knowlegde sharing.

OK let's start with "Documenting as code". Have fun! ;-)
Yes, we will! :-)
When? Now!

# Continuous Integration
A good definition can be found here: http://www.martinfowler.com/articles/continuousIntegration.html

***Continuous Integration is a software development practice where members of a team integrate their work frequently, usually each person integrates at least daily - leading to multiple integrations per day. Each integration is verified by an automated build (including test) to detect integration errors as quickly as possible. Many teams find that this approach leads to significantly reduced integration problems and allows a team to develop cohesive software more rapidly."***

# Continuous Delivery
Continous Delivery/deployment is the next step in getting yr software changes at the desired server in order to let your clients take a look at it.
This article provides a good example of it: http://www.martinfowler.com/articles/continuousIntegration.html

***To do Continuous Integration you need multiple environments, one to run commit tests, one or more to run secondary tests. Since you are moving executables between these environments multiple times a day, you'll want to do this automatically. So it's important to have scripts that will allow you to deploy the application into any environment easily.***
